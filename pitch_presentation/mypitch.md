## Why Ar.Sa Dance? {data-background="./Imgs/cuore.JPG" data-background-size="50% auto" data-background-position="right"}

Ar.Sa Dance has a loyal, mature fanbase but is now pivoting to attract younger dancers.

## My idea
* A modern, functional website designed to expand Ar.Sa Dance School’s digital reach. 
* The homepage highlights key milestones - including locations, years of experience, awards, and enrollment - to establish immediate credibility.

## The technology used 
* I implemented my HTML5, CSS and JavaScript codes with Bootstrap 5.3 components and W3Schools resources.
* This way, the site is fully responsive, ensuring a seamless experience on smartphones and tablets. 

## Long-term plans 

## Website
* Develop advanced interactive features, including real-time class booking systems and a dynamic events calendar for competitions and school performances.
* Enhance the 'About Us' section with a digital video archive to preserve and showcase the school’s origins.

## Social media
* Ar.Sa Dance recently launched Instagram and TikTok channels, featuring interviews and event highlights. 
* Short-form video tutorials on basic dance steps could attract beginners and younger demographics.
* A rebranding is recommended to establish a unified visual identity across all platforms.
