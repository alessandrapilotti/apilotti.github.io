## ![bg right:50%](./Imgs/mani.JPG) What is my project?

My project aims to establish Ar.Sa Dance School’s first web presence, providing a modern communication channel for both current members and newcomers.

---
## ![bg left:50%](./Imgs/cuore.JPG) Why Ar.Sa Dance?

Ar.Sa Dance has a loyal, mature fanbase but is now pivoting to attract younger dancers.

---
## My idea
* A modern, functional website designed to expand Ar.Sa Dance School’s digital reach. 

* The homepage highlights key milestones - including locations, years of experience, awards, and enrollment - to establish immediate credibility.

---
## The technology used 
* I implemented my HTML5, CSS and JavaScript codes with Bootstrap 5.3 components and W3Schools resources.

* This way, the site is fully responsive, ensuring a seamless experience on smartphones and tablets.

# Long-term plans 

---
## Website
* Develop advanced interactive features, including real-time class booking systems and a dynamic events calendar for competitions and school performances.

* Enhance the 'About Us' section with a digital video archive to preserve and showcase the school’s origins.

---
## Social media
* Ar.Sa Dance recently launched Instagram and TikTok channels, featuring interviews and event highlights. Also, short-form video tutorials on basic dance steps could attract beginners and younger demographics.

* A rebranding is recommended to establish a unified visual identity across all platforms.
